# 🔧 Fixed: MyReports Showing All Users' Issues

## ❌ Problem
MyReports page was showing **ALL issues from ALL users** instead of only the current user's issues.

## ✅ Solution
Updated the `issueService.js` to properly extract the `data` array from the backend API response.

### What Was Wrong:
The backend returns responses in this format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 5,
  "data": [/* array of issues */]
}
```

But the frontend was using the entire response object instead of just the `data` array.

### Files Modified:

#### `frontend/src/services/issueService.js`
Updated all methods to extract `response.data`:

1. ✅ **getUserIssues()** - Now returns only the current user's issues
2. ✅ **getAllIssues()** - Properly extracts data array
3. ✅ **getDashboardStats()** - Extracts stats data
4. ✅ **getIssueById()** - Extracts single issue data
5. ✅ **createIssue()** - Extracts created issue data

### How It Works Now:

```javascript
// Before (WRONG ❌)
getUserIssues: async (clerkId) => {
  return apiCall(`/issues/user/${clerkId}`);
  // Returns: { success: true, count: 5, data: [...] }
}

// After (CORRECT ✅)
getUserIssues: async (clerkId) => {
  const response = await apiCall(`/issues/user/${clerkId}`);
  return response.data || response; // Returns: [...]
}
```

## 🧪 How to Test:

### Test 1: Check Your Reports
1. Sign in as **User A**
2. Go to **My Reports** page
3. **Expected**: Only see issues YOU created
4. **Should NOT see**: Issues from other users

### Test 2: Create New Issue
1. While signed in as **User A**, create a new issue
2. Go to **My Reports**
3. **Expected**: Your new issue appears in the list

### Test 3: Multiple Users
1. Sign out
2. Sign in as **User B** (different account)
3. Go to **My Reports**
4. **Expected**: Empty list OR only User B's issues
5. **Should NOT see**: User A's issues

### Test 4: Dashboard Still Shows All
1. Go to **Dashboard** page
2. **Expected**: Shows ALL issues from ALL users (this is correct)
3. Stats should show total counts across all users

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Backend Filter (Already Working ✅)
```javascript
// backend/controllers/issueController.js - getUserIssues
const filter = { clerkId }; // Filters by user's Clerk ID
const issues = await Issue.find(filter).sort({ createdAt: -1 });
```

### Frontend Call (Now Fixed ✅)
```javascript
// frontend/src/pages/MyReports.jsx
const data = await issueService.getUserIssues(user.id);
// Now correctly receives only current user's issues
```

### API Response Structure
All backend responses follow this format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 3,
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "abc123",
      "clerkId": "user_xyz",
      "title": "Pothole on Main St",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before Fix ❌
```
MyReports (User A logged in):
- Pothole on Main St (User A) ✅
- Broken Light (User B) ❌ WRONG!
- Water Issue (User C) ❌ WRONG!
Total: 3 reports (INCORRECT)
```

### After Fix ✅
```
MyReports (User A logged in):
- Pothole on Main St (User A) ✅
Total: 1 report (CORRECT)
```

## 🎯 Why This Happened

The backend was **correctly filtering** by `clerkId`, but the frontend wasn't properly extracting the filtered data from the API response. The fix ensures all service methods properly unwrap the `data` property from responses.

## ✅ Status: FIXED

The MyReports page will now **only show the current user's issues**. Each user will see their own reports separately.
