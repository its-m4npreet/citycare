# File Upload Fix - Report New Issue Page

## Problem
The "Choose Files" button in the Report New Issue page was not working properly:
- Files were being stored in `formData.images` and `formData.videos` arrays
- Display section was checking for `formData.image` and `formData.video` (singular)
- Uploaded files were not visible to the user
- Could not remove individual files

## Root Cause
**Mismatch between data structure and UI:**
```javascript
// Files were stored as arrays:
setFormData((prev) => ({
  ...prev,
  images: [...prev.images, { name, url, size, file }],
  videos: [...prev.videos, { name, url, size, file }],
}));

// But UI was checking for singular properties:
{formData.image && <div>Photo: {formData.image.name}</div>}
{formData.video && <div>Video: {formData.video.name}</div>}
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Display Condition
**Before:**
```javascript
{(formData.image || formData.video) && (
  <div>...</div>
)}
```

**After:**
```javascript
{(formData.images.length > 0 || formData.videos.length > 0) && (
  <div>...</div>
)}
```

### 2. Added Map to Display All Files
**Before:** Checking single file
```javascript
{formData.image && (
  <div>Photo: {formData.image.name}</div>
)}
```

**After:** Mapping through all files
```javascript
{formData.images.map((img, index) => (
  <div key={`image-${index}`}>
    Photo: {img.name} ({(img.size / (1024 * 1024)).toFixed(2)} MB)
  </div>
))}
```

### 3. Added Individual File Removal
Each file now has its own remove button:
```javascript
<button
  onClick={() => {
    URL.revokeObjectURL(img.url); // Clean up blob URL
    setFormData((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      images: prev.images.filter((_, i) => i !== index),
    }));
  }}
>
  <FiX />
</button>
```

### 4. Added Visual Previews

**Image Preview:**
```javascript
<img
  src={img.url}
  alt={`Preview ${index + 1}`}
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    maxHeight: "200px",
    objectFit: "cover",
    borderRadius: "6px",
    border: "1px solid #bbf7d0",
  }}
/>
```

**Video Preview:**
```javascript
<video controls style={{ width: "100%", maxHeight: "200px" }}>
  <source src={vid.url} type={vid.file?.type} />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

### 5. Added Memory Cleanup
When removing files, blob URLs are properly cleaned up:
```javascript
URL.revokeObjectURL(img.url); // Prevents memory leaks
```

## How to Test

1. **Start the app:**
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Report New Issue page**

3. **Test Image Upload:**
   - Click "Choose Files"
   - Select one or more images
   - Should see green cards with image previews
   - Each card shows file name and size
   - Click X to remove individual images

4. **Test Video Upload:**
   - Click "Choose Files"
   - Select one or more videos
   - Should see blue cards with video players
   - Can play videos in the preview
   - Click X to remove individual videos

5. **Test Mixed Upload:**
   - Select both images and videos together
   - Should see all files displayed
   - Can remove any file individually

6. **Test File Size Limits:**
   - Images > 10MB should show alert
   - Videos > 50MB should show alert
   - Invalid files are rejected

## File Structure

```javascript
formData = {
  title: string,
  category: string,
  description: string,
  location: string,
  coordinates: { lat: number, lng: number } | null,
  urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical',
  images: [
    { name: string, url: string, size: number, file: File }
  ],
  videos: [
    { name: string, url: string, size: number, file: File }
  ]
}
```

## Backend Submission

When submitting, only the first image and first video are sent:
```javascript
const files = {};
if (formData.images.length > 0) {
  files.image = formData.images[0].file;
}
if (formData.videos.length > 0) {
  files.video = formData.videos[0].file;
}
```

**Note:** To send multiple files, the backend API and issueService.createIssue need to be updated to handle arrays of files.

## Improvements Made

1. ✅ Fixed data structure mismatch
2. ✅ Added file previews (images and videos)
3. ✅ Individual file removal buttons
4. ✅ Shows file size in MB
5. ✅ Memory cleanup on removal
6. ✅ Better visual feedback with icons
7. ✅ Proper key props for React lists
8. ✅ Color-coded cards (green for images, blue for videos)

## Files Modified

- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/ReportNewIssue.jsx`

## Known Limitations

⚠️ **Multiple File Submission:**
Currently, only the first image and first video are submitted to the backend. To submit all files, you need to:
1. Update backend to accept multiple files
2. Update issueService.createIssue to send all files
3. Update FormData append logic to handle arrays

**Current:**
```javascript
if (formData.images.length > 0) {
  files.image = formData.images[0].file; // Only first image
}
```

**For Multiple Files (Future Enhancement):**
```javascript
formData.images.forEach((img, index) => {
  formData.append('images', img.file);
});
```

## Success Criteria

✅ "Choose Files" button opens file picker  
✅ Selected files are displayed immediately  
✅ Image previews are visible  
✅ Video players are functional  
✅ File names and sizes are shown  
✅ Individual files can be removed  
✅ Memory is cleaned up properly  
✅ No console errors  
✅ Files are submitted to backend correctly
