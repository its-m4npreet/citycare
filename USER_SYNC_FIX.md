# 🔧 Fixed: "User Not Found" Error

## ❌ Problem
When creating a report, the backend shows: **"User not found. Please create a profile first."**

This happens even though you're logged in with Clerk (as admin).

## ✅ Solution
Updated the frontend to automatically sync Clerk users to the MongoDB database before allowing report creation.

## 🔍 Root Cause

### The Issue Flow:
```
1. User signs in with Clerk ✅
2. Clerk authentication works ✅
3. User tries to create a report
4. Frontend sends clerkId to backend
5. Backend looks for user in MongoDB database ❌
6. User doesn't exist in MongoDB yet!
7. Error: "User not found"
```

### Why It Happened:
The `ReportNewIssue` page was using Clerk's `useUser` hook directly, which only checks Clerk authentication. It wasn't using our custom `useUser` hook that syncs users to MongoDB.

## 🛠️ Files Fixed

### 1. **frontend/src/pages/ReportNewIssue.jsx**

#### Before (WRONG ❌):
```javascript
import { useUser } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

const { user } = useUser(); // Only Clerk user, not in database!
```

#### After (CORRECT ✅):
```javascript
import { useUser } from "../hooks/useUser";

const { clerkUser: user, dbUser, loading: userLoading } = useUser();

// Added checks before submission:
if (userLoading) {
  alert('Please wait while we sync your account...');
  return;
}

if (!dbUser) {
  alert('Unable to sync your account. Please try again.');
  return;
}
```

### 2. **frontend/src/hooks/useUser.js**
- ✅ Added console.log to verify user sync
- ✅ Automatically creates/updates user in MongoDB when you sign in
- ✅ Returns both `clerkUser` and `dbUser`

### 3. **frontend/src/services/userService.js**
- ✅ Updated to extract `response.data` (like we did for issues)
- ✅ `createOrUpdateUser()` now returns the user object directly
- ✅ `getUserByClerkId()` extracts data properly
- ✅ `getUserStats()` extracts data properly

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Automatic User Sync Flow:
```
1. User signs in with Clerk ✅
       ↓
2. useUser hook detects sign-in ✅
       ↓
3. Automatically calls userService.createOrUpdateUser() ✅
       ↓
4. Backend creates user in MongoDB ✅
       ↓
5. User can now create reports! ✅
```

### User Data Synced:
```javascript
{
  clerkId: "user_abc123",           // From Clerk
  email: "admin@example.com",       // From Clerk
  firstName: "Admin",               // From Clerk
  lastName: "User",                 // From Clerk
  imageUrl: "https://...",          // From Clerk
  phone: "+1234567890",             // From Clerk
  role: "admin"                     // From Clerk metadata
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Fresh Sign In
1. ✅ Sign out if currently signed in
2. ✅ Sign in with your admin account
3. ✅ Open browser console (F12)
4. ✅ Look for: `"User synced to database: {...}"`
5. ✅ Go to Report New Issue
6. ✅ Fill out the form
7. ✅ Submit
8. ✅ Should work now! ✅

### Test 2: Check Database Sync
1. ✅ Sign in
2. ✅ Open browser console
3. ✅ You should see:
   ```
   User synced to database: {
     _id: "...",
     clerkId: "user_abc123",
     email: "admin@example.com",
     firstName: "Admin",
     ...
   }
   ```

### Test 3: Create Report
1. ✅ Navigate to "Report New Issue"
2. ✅ Fill out the form:
   - Title: "Test Issue"
   - Category: "Potholes"
   - Description: "Testing user sync"
   - Location: "Test Location"
   - Urgency: "Medium"
3. ✅ Click "Submit Report"
4. ✅ Should see: "Issue reported successfully! Issue ID: ..."
5. ✅ No more "User not found" error! ✅

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before Fix ❌
```
Sign In → Report Issue → Error: "User not found"
(Clerk user exists, MongoDB user doesn't exist)
```

### After Fix ✅
```
Sign In → Auto Sync to MongoDB → Report Issue → Success!
(Both Clerk user and MongoDB user exist)
```

## 🔍 Debugging

### If Still Getting "User Not Found":

#### 1. Check Browser Console
Look for:
```
✅ "User synced to database: {...}"
❌ "Error syncing user: ..."
```

#### 2. Check Backend Terminal
Look for:
```
✅ POST /api/users/profile 201 (User created)
✅ POST /api/users/profile 200 (User updated)
❌ POST /api/users/profile 500 (Error)
```

#### 3. Verify Backend is Running
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
Should show:
```
🚀 Server running on port 5000
✅ MongoDB Connected
```

#### 4. Check Environment Variables

**frontend/.env**:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

**backend/.env**:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://smeet:smeet@cluster0...
```

### If User Sync Fails:

1. **Check MongoDB Connection**:
   - Backend terminal should show "✅ MongoDB Connected"
   - If not, check MONGODB_URI in backend/.env

2. **Check Clerk Configuration**:
   - Verify VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY in frontend/.env
   - Make sure you're signed in to Clerk

3. **Clear Cache & Reload**:
   - Sign out
   - Clear browser cache
   - Sign in again
   - Check console for sync message

## 🎯 What Happens on Sign In

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **User signs in with Clerk**
   ```javascript
   // Clerk handles authentication
   ```

2. **useUser hook activates**
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     if (isSignedIn && clerkUser) {
       syncUser(); // Automatically called
     }
   }, [clerkUser, isSignedIn]);
   ```

3. **User data sent to backend**
   ```javascript
   POST /api/users/profile
   {
     clerkId: "user_abc123",
     email: "admin@example.com",
     firstName: "Admin",
     ...
   }
   ```

4. **Backend creates/updates user**
   ```javascript
   // Check if user exists
   let user = await User.findOne({ clerkId });
   
   if (!user) {
     // Create new user
     user = await User.create({ clerkId, email, ... });
   }
   ```

5. **User can now create reports**
   ```javascript
   // Backend can find user
   const user = await User.findOne({ clerkId });
   // user exists! ✅
   ```

## ✅ Summary of Changes

### Frontend Changes:
1. ✅ ReportNewIssue uses custom useUser hook (not Clerk's)
2. ✅ Added loading and dbUser checks before submission
3. ✅ userService methods extract `response.data`
4. ✅ useUser hook logs sync confirmation

### Backend Changes:
None needed! Backend was already working correctly.

### What This Fixes:
- ✅ "User not found" error when creating reports
- ✅ Users automatically synced to MongoDB on sign in
- ✅ Admin users can create reports immediately
- ✅ All Clerk users are saved to database

## 🎉 Result

Now when you sign in:
1. ✅ Clerk authenticates you
2. ✅ Frontend automatically syncs your account to MongoDB
3. ✅ Backend can find your user record
4. ✅ You can create reports without errors!

**Status**: 🟢 **FIXED**

Just **refresh your browser** and **sign in again** to trigger the automatic user sync!
